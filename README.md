# Haptic Wearable for Education

A simple, low cost haptic wearable for education and prototyping based around a Voice Coil and an ESP 32 smart speaker.

## Description

This wearable is a platform for education in haptics and human computer interaction (HCI). This wristband haptic wearable contains a voice coil actuator that provides feedback through vibrations, felt on the user's skin. This product enables students and novice hapticians to quickly begin prototyping with advanced haptic feedback waveforms. This device offers a low cost way to mimic wearables such as a SmartWatch without the full need for complex hardware. For example, it can vibrate with a steady pulse to indicate an incoming call or message, or it could vibrate in a more complex pattern to convey the direction of a turn while navigating. Users can connect to this device using Bluetooth, and send audio signals directly to the device.
